          description: <p>Working in the laboratory over the summers helped me realize that my 
                    true passion lies in conducting hands-on research. Thus, my colleague and I designed 
                    a study to understand the ecological advantage of depression in Zebra Fish. This is 
                    an ongoing laboratory project under Dr. Rajaraman's guidance. Considering the relative dearth 
                    of literature studying the ‘advantage’ of depression, my college and I aim to find 
                    out how this mental health disorder could have a survival advantage for an organism. 
                    We specifically chose to study zebra fish because its genetic system is very similar 
                    to that of mammals, and this model has been previously used in medical trials for its 
                    direct implication in human systems.</p>
                    <p>As of now, baseline measures have been taken for the pilot study. In the Spring 
                    of 2023, we will be beginning our experimental trials. The exact details of the study 
                    are not public yet.</p>
                    <p>My experience of working in this laboratory has been extremely fruitful for the skills
                    I have gained and for the relationships I have built. Handling Zebra Fish, and its 
                    larvae–requires an enormous amount of practice. I am grateful to have been able 
                    to learn these skills while working in the laboratory for almost a year now. Further, 
                    working with the research team, and presenting and critiquing papers in every 
                    laboratory meeting has strengthened my critical thinking and communication skills.</p>

    summary: 
    description: Under the guidance of Dr. Madhavilatha Maganti, this study will be 
                conducted to identify specific patterns in the play behavior of children 
                with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) using feature sets from the Four-fold 
                Framework (also developed as a part of this study)

          description: <p> Although conceptually 
                        derived from the work of Smith and Gasser (2005):The Development of 
                        Embodied Cognition:Six Lessons from Babies, while they engage in 
                        object-directed play sessions. The frame-by-frame microgenetic study of 
                        their dyadic play will aid parents, instructors, and researchers recognize 
                        patterns, diversity, repetition, and stereotypicality in the play behaviors 
                        of atypical children, eventually helping them with an environment that will 
                        potentiate the development of their socio-cognitive, communication, and 
                        emotional skills.  </p>

                        <p>The study aims to bridge this gap by studying play behaviors using feature 
                        sets consisting of behavioral codes that systematically operationalize 
                        observable behaviors during play (Bakeman & Quera, 2012; Chorney et al., 
                        2015). The microgenetic approach which will be taken for this study provides 
                        scope for making detailed narrative descriptions of observations made by 
                        researchers for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the behavioral pattern 
                        of play displayed by children with ASD while engaging in object-directed play 
                        activities (van Geert, 1998; Fogel, 2011; Fogel, 2011).</p>

                        <p>Data collected from Dr. Shabina’s center, Assam Autism Foundation, was used 
                        by the researchers to operationalize variables, develop codes, check for validity, 
                        learn behavioral coding, check for reliability and develop the research template. 
                        Each videotaped session was coded, frame-by-frame, using a fine-graded qualitative 
                        analysis using the Four-fold Observation Framework developed by the research team.</p>

                        <p>This project helped me understand how children with ASD engage in complex behaviors, 
                        especially while engaging in play. The observation of behavior helped us to understand 
                        the dyadic and triadic relationship that children with ASD share with toys and their 
                        parents/instructor, respectively. with every change in subject, we truly realized that 
                        Autism is a spectrum and people with ASD are placed differently in terms of abilities 
                        and how they cope with tasks and emotions. Like any typical individual, children with 
                        ASD too have different needs, strengths, and weaknesses. </p>

                        <p>In the process of noting their specific behaviors in the videos, I learned how to 
                        operationalize activities that were observed — and develop codes and sub-codes for them. 
                        The entire process of coding, checking for the reliability of the coding by doing secondary 
                        coding not only gave me an on-ground application of qualitative research but also helped us 
                        gain skills that are essential while working in a team. I not only identified coding discrepancies 
                        between the researchers but also found ways to revisit the coding where there were disagreements 
                        and discussed them together to resolve them. </p>
