          description: <p>Working in the laboratory over the summers helped me realize that my 
                    true passion lies in conducting hands-on research. Thus, my colleague and I designed 
                    a study to understand the ecological advantage of depression in Zebra Fish. This is 
                    an ongoing laboratory project under Dr. Rajaraman's guidance. Considering the relative dearth 
                    of literature studying the ‘advantage’ of depression, my college and I aim to find 
                    out how this mental health disorder could have a survival advantage for an organism. 
                    We specifically chose to study zebra fish because its genetic system is very similar 
                    to that of mammals, and this model has been previously used in medical trials for its 
                    direct implication in human systems.</p>
                    <p>As of now, baseline measures have been taken for the pilot study. In the Spring 
                    of 2023, we will be beginning our experimental trials. The exact details of the study 
                    are not public yet.</p>
                    <p>My experience of working in this laboratory has been extremely fruitful for the skills
                    I have gained and for the relationships I have built. Handling Zebra Fish, and its 
                    larvae–requires an enormous amount of practice. I am grateful to have been able 
                    to learn these skills while working in the laboratory for almost a year now. Further, 
                    working with the research team, and presenting and critiquing papers in every 
                    laboratory meeting has strengthened my critical thinking and communication skills.</p>
